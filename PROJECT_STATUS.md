## üéØ **Current Priority**

**NEXT STEP: Generate UI components with Stitch AI**

1. Start with shared UI components (Button, Input, Card)
2. Use descriptions from `STITCH_AI_SCREENS.md` ‚Üí Common Components section
3. Then proceed to screen generation one by one
4. Test each screen as you build

---

## üìù **Development Notes**

### API Integration
- Currently pointing to web API at `http://localhost:3000/api`
- Will need to create separate mobile backend later
- For now, reusing web APIs is fine for MVP

### Authentication
- Supabase Auth planned but not implemented
- Can skip auth for initial development
- Focus on core features first

### State Management
- React Query handles all server state
- Zustand for local UI state (minimal usage)
- No Redux needed (simpler is better)

### Performance Targets
- First contentful paint: <2s
- Time to interactive: <3s
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Minimal bundle size (<20MB)

## üöÄ **How to Continue**

1. **Use Stitch AI to generate components:**
   ```
   "Generate a Button component based on this description: [paste from STITCH_AI_SCREENS.md]"
   ```

2. **Implement screens one by one:**
   - Start with Home Screen (simplest)
   - Then Response Screen (data visualization)
   - Then Feed Screen (list optimization)
   - Then Profile, Filter, Auth

3. **Connect to APIs:**
   - Use existing hooks from `src/features/posts/hooks/`
   - API client already configured
   - Just wire up to UI components

4. **Test on real device:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   # Scan QR code with Expo Go app
   ```

5. **Iterate and polish:**
   - Add animations
   - Improve UX
   - Handle edge cases
   - Optimize performance
