# 🎨 Themed Days - Enhanced Vision
## Daily Vibe Feeds for Different Moods & Moments

---

## 🎯 Core Concept

**Each day of the week has its own unique FEED with a specific vibe, purpose, and community.**

Instead of just a hashtag challenge, each day becomes a **destination** - a special space where people gather to share thoughts/actions/plans that fit that day's energy.
